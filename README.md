Linear regression is a type of supervised machine-learning algorithm that learns from the labelled datasets and maps the data points with most optimized linear functions which can be used for prediction on new datasets. It assumes that there is a linear relationship between the input and output, meaning the output changes at a constant rate as the input changes. This relationship is represented by a straight line.

For example we want to predict a student's exam score based on how many hours they studied. We observe that as students study more hours, their scores go up. In the example of predicting exam scores based on hours studied. Here

    Independent variable (input): Hours studied because it's the factor we control or observe.
    Dependent variable (output): Exam score because it depends on how many hours were studied.
